The Feather M0 has a small disk drive so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing
which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index 
or .Trashes files!

The pre-loaded demo shows off what your Feather M0 can do with CircuitPython:

  * The built in NeoPixel LED can show any color
    It will swirl through the rainbow

  * Pin A0 is a true analog output, when buttons on D3 or D4 are pressed to 
    ground audio files will play from the onboard storage to A0 (You'll need to
    wire up a speaker or headphones to hear it!

  * Pin A1 is an analog input, the REPL will display the voltage on this pin 
    (0-3.3V is the max range)

  * Pin A2 is a capacitive input, when touched, it will turn on the red LED. 

  * Pin D6, D9 and D10 are digital inputs with pull-ups, you can touch them to 
    GND to activate button (or wire up a tactile button or switch!)
    - If you update main.py to uncomment the relevant lines, D6 will act as a 
       mini keyboard and emulate an 'a' key-press whenever D6 is grounded.
    - When D9 and D10 are grounded, audio files will play out of A0

  * Pin D5 is a NeoPixel output
    You can wire up a strip of NeoPixels to this pin (power from USB and GND). 
    The first 16 NeoPixel will rainbow swirl

  * Pin D12 can be connected to a servo which will sweep back and forth. Power
    the servo from 5V and GND.

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing main.py in your favorite text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes
with a built in REPL serial viewer! It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest 
code. Try enabling the single-button keyboard!
         (HINT: look for the "# optional! uncomment below..." text)

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, 
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). 
On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 
On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
