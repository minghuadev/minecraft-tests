              - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
            restart: unless-stopped
            healthcheck:
              test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://<your-domain>:8123"]
              interval: 1m
              timeout: 10s
              retries: 3
              start_period: 40s

        static IP address, limit recorder entities, naming conventions like domain.room_location_number, 
        use trigger IDs in automations, use VPN SSL 2FA etc for security, plan for intenet and network outages, 
        segment iot network, regularly validate configuration, use node-red for advanced automation or 
        AdGuard for network-wide ad blocking
