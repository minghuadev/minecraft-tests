  ya'akov dec 4: 
    the most versatile is a roll-your-own system based on node-red with or without home assistant.
    this is also the most work.

    Cheap and cheerful is Sonoff. Flexible but plug-and-play is Smarthings.
 **
    Well made and somewhat universal is Shelly.
    Plug-and-play but not particularly end-hacker friendly is Amazon Alexa.
    Apple user focused and nicely done is HomeKit (also the most expensive in the end).
