npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async reque
sts by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated fstream-ignore@1.0.5: This package is no longer supported.
npm warn deprecated uid-number@0.0.6: This package is no longer supported.

Removing .git directory...

Success! Created my-app at C:\Users\nodeuser\my-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

*** 
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

*** 
  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

*** 
  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

*** 
  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

*** 
  cd my-app
  npm start

Happy hacking!
