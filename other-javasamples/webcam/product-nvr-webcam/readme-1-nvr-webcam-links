    I use Frigate (https://frigate.video/) on a rPI for recording and doing person detection for 3 Reolink cameras. 
    Connecting that to HomeAssistant for dashboard and notifications. 
    And here is the video that introduced me to Frigate:

    I tried pretty much all of them, now I'm working on my own NVR 
    (https://eternityforest.com/doku/doku.php?id=tech:nvr).
    For the cameras themselves, Amcrest is good enough for me, but the PineCube looks like it has potential.

    I am running Wyze v2 cameras with RTSP firmware on them, using Homebrige and Scrypted. 
    People are also liking camera.ui too.
