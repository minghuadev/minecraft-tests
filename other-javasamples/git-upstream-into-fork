    Make sure you've pulled the new upstream branch into your local repo:
    First, ensure your working tree is clean (commit/stash/revert any changes)
    Then, do `git fetch upstream` to retrieve the new upstream branch

    Create and switch to a local version of the new upstream branch (which is named 
    newbranch in this example):
    `git checkout -b newbranch upstream/newbranch`

    When you're ready to push the new branch to origin:
    `git push -u origin newbranch`

    The -u switch sets up tracking to the specified remote (in this example, origin)
