search miner in rust lang
https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9qgry9/announcing_powhasher_monero_miner_in_pure_rust/
    https://github.com/kazcw/powhasher

    Monero has tweaked their algorithm enough to break all my opcode-level optimizations, 
    I'd open-source the project. I wrote a core for the new algo in Rust based on stdsimd intrinsics 
    (and found a rustc bug in the process https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55249), and 
    now it's pure Rust except for deep dependencies like libc and some ancillary hashing functions 
    (which I rewrote the buffer munging for in Rust, but used the C/ASM simd code from their 
    reference implementations). The miner itself is quite simple, and just hooks together 
    two constituent libraries with some efficient synchronization:

    the simd pipelined-hasher implementation: yellowsun https://github.com/kazcw/yellowsun
    the stratum protocol client: cn-stratum https://github.com/kazcw/cn-stratum
