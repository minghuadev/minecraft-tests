    DigiCert Enterprise lets you pre-validate your domain and then do large-scale subdomain 
    certificate generation. (Disclosure: I do not work for DigiCert, but my employer uses their 
    certificate services.) â€“ Moshe Katz Jun 19 '14 at 23:12

    to authenticate an SSL connection you do NOT want to add the certificate of the endpoint 
    you are connecting to in your keystore. You only want the intermediate and root 
    Certificate Authorities. In some cases, only the root CA or else you will get 
    an exception. See this great blog post for more info.

    $ openssl s_client -connect graph.facebook.com:443 -showcerts
