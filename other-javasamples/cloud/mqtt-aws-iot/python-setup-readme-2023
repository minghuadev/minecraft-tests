  the aws-iot-device-sdk-python-v2 when installed is called awsiotsdk.
  the current awsiotsdk git tag is v1.19.0 plus one commit on the main branch, 
  its installed version shows as 1.0.0.dev0 .

  the installed version of awscrt is 0.19.1 . its source should be at:

  to run the sdk pubsub sample, the samples/utils/ needs to be in python path.

  put the following to a bat file to run two messages:

   python pubsub.py ^
    --endpoint a312345678abc4-ats.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com ^
    --ca_file connect_device_package-wn3\root-CA.crt ^
    --cert connect_device_package-wn3\MyIotThing2.cert.pem ^
    --key connect_device_package-wn3\MyIotThing2.private.key ^
    --client_id basicPubSub --topic sdk/test/python --count 2

  in the end the tutorial suggests to explore: registry, shadow, rule.

tips: multiple certificates

  each time on aws iot console connecting a single device to an existing thing, 
  it creates a new certificate to use. 

tips: multiple devices to the same thing

  search aws iot can you connect multiple devices to the same thing

  stackoverflow 37576646/how-to-connect-multiple-devices-to-same-thing-in-aws-iot
  connecting multiple devices to same thing: 
    [1] use a different client id. same client id keeps only one connection.
    [2] embed the device identification in topic or payload. 
    [3] only one shadow, multiple devices cannot use shadow.
