    it's more common for mobile apps to use Cognito identities than X.509 certificates. 
    and to use mobile sdk or amplify to publish and subscripbe to aws iot core.

aws iot service console start package: 

  connect one device from aws console, and choose linux, java. 
  the start.sh contains: 

    package: aws-iot-device-sdk-java-v2

    issue 87: how to build crt
      build for "Failed to resolve: software.amazon.awssdk.crtandroid:0.6.5"

        git clone git@github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-java
        cd aws-crt-java
        git checkout v0.6.5
        cd android
        ./gradlew build
        ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal

        ls -R .m2/repository/software/amazon/awssdk/crt

  build and publish the sdk to maven local. modify its gradle.build to work-around some bugs.
  build the sample app, it builds ok.

    if we don't build and publish sdk to maven local, the sample won't build. 
    though we can find the sdk here: 
        https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk.iotdevicesdk/aws-iot-device-sdk?smo=true
        https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/software/amazon/awssdk/iotdevicesdk/aws-iot-device-sdk/1.17.0/

  removed the project directory, and re-did it again. the sample app builds without building sdk first.

    speculation: 
            [1] previously attempted to build the sdk first, and it failed. the failure might have 
                 left some damaged/temporary files in the ide. that might have caused the sample app
                 build to fail.
            [2] another possibility could be that the local build has left the library installed 
                 at ~/.m2/... location.
                 more likely it is [2] not [1].

  the android sample app has a bug in its build.gradle in sample paths, missing a slash in all samples.

  from issue 346

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_downgrade_and_exclude.html#sec:excluding-transitive-deps

  used aws libraries: from the android studio it can be seen 
        gradle: software.amazon.awssdk.crt:aws-crt-android:0.27.3@aar
        gradle: software.amazon.awssdk.iotdevicesdk:aws-iot-device-sdk-android:1.17.0@aar

  search online for where the android studio keeps dependencies, two locations:
        one that the ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/file2-2.1/, where we can find the aws-crt-android-0.27.3.aar .
        another at ~/.m2/repository/... where we can find the aws-iot-device-sdk-android-1.17.0.aar .

    search for files named "aws*" and with "crt" or "iot", under ~/.gradle/caches and ~/.m2/ ,
    found the "-android-" files. guess those were from previous maven local install

  verify:  under samples/Android/app run  ./gradlew.bat :dependencies  to see dep graph and configuration



use these libraires in nordic blinky:

  https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/f/nordic-q-a/96818/gradle-build-failed-android-nrf-blinky
  https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-Gradle-Plugins

  because the type of nrf-blinky versionCatalogs.create() is a VersionCatalogBuilder, 
  searching for "kotlin VersionCatalogBuilder", turns up this issue: for multiple files
    https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/20383 

  look at the  settings.gradle.kts
  search android studio version catalog dependencyResolutionManagement
  https://engineering.teknasyon.com/a-simple-guide-to-version-catalog-implementation-in-android-17d0ff3fd1f
    a simple guide to version catalog implementation in android using toml format

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html
    the official gradle doc

  result summary: 
        the nordic blinky uses gradle 7.4, that has version catalog stable.
        adding to the  settings.gradle.kts  below the  from("no.nordic...:1.1.3")  line: 
                library("<alias>", "<group>", <artifacts>).version("1.17.0")
            e.g.: 
            settings.gradle.kts
                dependencyResolutionManagement {
                    ...
                    versionCatalogs { // MutableVersionCatalogContainer
                        create("libs") { // VersionCatalogBuilder
                            from("no.nodic...-catalog:1.1.3" /* dependencyNotation */ )
              +             library("aws-iot-device-sdi" /* alias */,
              +                  "software.amazon.awssdk.iotdevicesdk" /* group */, 
              +                  "aws-iot-device-sdk-android" /* artifact */).version("1.17.0")

        adding to the  app/build.gradle.kts :  replace "-" with "." in alias
                api(libs.<alias>)
            e.g.: 
            build.gradle.kts multiple files in different component directories
                dependencies {
                    ...
                    implementation(project(":awsiotsamples" /* path */)
              +     //api('software.amazon.awssdk.iotdevicesdk:aws-iot-device-sdk-android:1.17.0')
              +     api(libs.aws.iot.device.sdk)
                    implementation(libs.nordic.theme)

        after gradle sync, verify the external library versions of crt and iot-device-sdk.



upgrade android studio: 

  2023-11-16
  previously used android studio version 2021.3.1 built on aug 31 2022, from .16-windows.zip file.
  upgrade to android studio version 2022.3.1 pathc 4 built on nov 13 2023, from .22 zip file.

  fix: 
    it failed to find dependency
        fix by: 
              -                  "aws-iot-device-sdk-android" /* artifact */).version("1.17.0")
              +                  "aws-iot-device-sdk"         /* artifact */).version("1.17.5")

        so the maven central version does not have "-android" in its name.
        previous builds could have been ok if using the non-"android" names, without maven local. 

        it also updates the aws-crt to 0.28.5

  search maven aws-crt-android, it turns out the central holds two crt names: 
        https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/software.amazon.awssdk.crt
          one named aws-crt, another aws-crt-android

  search maven aws-iot-device-sdk, it turns out no -android version.
