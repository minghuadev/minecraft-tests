You can also bind to $ OPENSHIFT_Cart_Name_PORT (8080) for HTTP connectivity, 
which reroutes externally through port 80.

9.9.1. Configuring WebSocket Ports
Because the main routing layer is currently based on Apache, WebSocket can be used by connecting to
specific ports on an application. WebSocket connections are supported with browser based applications
on OpenShift Online, allowing bidirectional communication without requiring multiple, open HTTP
connections. The TCP based protocol uses HTTP as an initiation handshake which is handled as an
upgrade request. If successful, the connection remains open and switches to the WebSocket protocol.
For plain WebSocket connections (ws://), requests are directed to port 8000, while WebSocket Secure
connections (wss://) use port 8443, as shown in the following example:
http://example.example.com:8000
https://example.example.com:8443
