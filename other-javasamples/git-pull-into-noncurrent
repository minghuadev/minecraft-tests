let's say current checked-out branch is master. but want to pull upstream 
branch br1 and to have downstream repo be able to track. 

modify downstream : 

    remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    branch.br1.merge=refs/heads/br1

to : 

    remote.origin.fetch=+refs/remotes/origin/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    branch.br1.merge=refs/remotes/origin/br1

then use `git pull` to get upstream br1 into origin/br1 .

at the downstream use `git pull` to pull from origin/br1 . and use 
`git push` to push to this repo br1 branch.
