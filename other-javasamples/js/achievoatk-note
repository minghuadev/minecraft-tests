Achievo ATK - Web application development framework
Achievo ATK is an object oriented Web-application Framework, written in PHP. It is targeted at developers who wish to focus on business logic, instead of coding HTML. Where other application frameworks mainly provide a large set of utility classes, ATK provides a complete framework that requires only small amounts of code to get usable applications, while maintaining full flexibility.

It is currently the back-end software for the 'achievo' project management/project tracking tool.
