jdk: save to ~/.jdks/openjdk-22 oracle openjdk 22.0.1

  the first time opened the idea to run the learning ide tutorial it asked for 
  downloading a sdk, and prompted many options. the openjdk 22 is the latest. 
  thus selected it.

  after running some examples to build, it turned out the bundled jdk version 
  is an amazon corretto 21. jdk 22 won't work. not sure it won't work with 
  the gradle sync only or the build as well.

  when building the nrf blinky example it automatically switched to corretto 17 
  and downloaded it. 

  from the above it can be seen as a mistake to download jdk 22.
