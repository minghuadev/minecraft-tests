Each predicted keypoint is specified by an (x,y) real-valued pair in the space of pixel indices.
There are 15 keypoints, which represent the following elements of the face:

left_eye_center, right_eye_center, left_eye_inner_corner, left_eye_outer_corner, right_eye_inner_corner,
right_eye_outer_corner, left_eyebrow_inner_end, left_eyebrow_outer_end, right_eyebrow_inner_end,
right_eyebrow_outer_end, nose_tip, mouth_left_corner, mouth_right_corner, mouth_center_top_lip,
mouth_center_bottom_lip

Left and right here refers to the point of view of the subject.

In some examples, some of the target keypoint positions are misssing (encoded as missing entries in
the csv, i.e., with nothing between two commas).

The input image is given in the last field of the data files, and consists of a list of pixels
(ordered by row), as integers in (0,255). The images are 96x96 pixels.

Data files

    training.csv: list of training 7049 images. Each row contains the (x,y) coordinates for
        15 keypoints, and image data as row-ordered list of pixels.
    test.csv: list of 1783 test images. Each row contains ImageId and image data as row-ordered
        list of pixels
    submissionFileFormat.csv: list of 27124 keypoints to predict. Each row contains a RowId,
        ImageId, FeatureName, Location. FeatureName are "left_eye_center_x," "right_eyebrow_outer_end_y,"
        etc. Location is what you need to predict.
