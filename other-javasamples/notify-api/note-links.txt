A2:    
    Presumably you are looking for a ready to install packaged solution? 
    There is none I know of, however, in case you are comfortable with 
    assembling some readily available components with a modest amount of 
    custom code, you could build yourself a dedicated solution by means 
    of the extremely versatile Apache Camel framework, which is a powerful 
    open source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

    
    It includes an ever growing list of components out of the box to interface 
    with existing tools/protocols/APIs/etc., e.g. for cloning the Amazon SNS functionality:

        Mail Component - provides access to Email via Spring's Mail support and 
                         the underlying JavaMail system
        HTTP4 Component - provides HTTP based endpoints for consuming external HTTP 
                          resources (as a client to call external servers using HTTP)
        SMPP Component - provides access to an SMSC (Short Message Service Center) 
                         over the SMPP protocol to send and receive SMS
        AWS Components - even those are available, in case you'd like to use them as well still
            SNS Component - For Messaging with Amazon's Simple Notification Service (SNS) service
            SQS Component - For Messaging with Amazon's Simple Queue Service (SQS) service

    Assembling the components is remarkably simple indeed, and there are lots of 
    Examples available, see for example the walkthroughs for configuration via 
    Spring DSL (XML based) or via Java code

    Granted, assembling a decently performing and scaling system like so will still 
    require a fair amount of knowledge, but Apache Camel at least removes 
    the burden regarding many of the involved tasks already.
