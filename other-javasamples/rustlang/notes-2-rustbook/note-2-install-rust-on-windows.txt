          create a cargo project.
          cd into the directory, and launch vscode by "code ." command.
          open the source code, set a breakpoint, and run debugger. 
          the first time you should get an error for no launch configuration, 
          clock ok, then you get a prompt to generate a launch configuration. 
          after generating the launch configuration, it is good to debug.
