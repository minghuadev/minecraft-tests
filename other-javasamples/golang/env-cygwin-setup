note that the following .bashrc setup does not work. need to set through windows 
control panel system environment. then can modify by invoking "cmd" from cygwin 
terminal and run windows command or bat file like
    set "GOPATH=%GOPATH%;C:\Users\me\proj\libs"
and then can run go build run install command from cmd command line

go and cygwin!

These settings in cygwin worked for me to get the go command lines to work as indicated in the tutorial videos:

1. add these 3 lines into your ~/.bashrc file:
export GOPATH='C:\cygwin\home\your_user_name\go_workspace'
export GOBIN='C:\cygwin\home\your_user_name\go_workspace\bin'
export PATH=$PATH:'/cygdrive/c/cygwin/home/your_user_name/go_workspace/bin'

2. source ~/.bashc

3. verify GOBIN is set with "go env" (My output looks like):l
go env
set GOROOT=C:\Go
set GOBIN=C:\cygwin\home\your_user_name\go_workspace\bin
set GOARCH=amd64
set GOCHAR=6
set GOOS=windows
set GOEXE=.exe
set GOHOSTARCH=amd64
set GOHOSTOS=windows
set GOTOOLDIR=C:\Go\pkg\tool\windows_amd64
set GOGCCFLAGS=-g -O2 -m64 -mthreads


2/ Create a go workspace directory (name is optional but needs to match the export Env vars in .bashrc):
cd ~/.
mkdir ./go_workspace
mkdir ./go_workspace/src
mkdir ./go_workspace/bin
mkdir ./go_workspace/pkg
mkdir ./go_workspace/pkg/windows_amd64 (NOTE: GOARCH can be determined from the "go env" output... mine is amd64 and cygwin is on windows)

Then the "go install", "go build", "go test" commands all worked without errors.
