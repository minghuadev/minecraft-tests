use `samples/microblaze-xilinx-elf/crosstool.config` as `.config`
run `make menuconfig` to enable experimental support CT_EXPERIMENTAL ---no need


use ./ct-ng menuconfig to config       ---    use logb-dot-config  
                                       --- or use logc-dot-config that is with LTO for gcc
                                       --- note: logb-dot-config was done on ubuntu 14
                                       ---       logc-dot-config is done on ubuntu 18


configurtion: 
    no MMU
    set endianness to match your synthesized target (the default is big-endian)
    build a multilib toolchain (that way you can adjust compilation based on 
        selected Microblaze CPU options, for example the barrel shifter is optional)
    build a sysrooted toolchain using cross-compilation
    the target operating system is  `bare-metal`
    the target binary format is ELF
    for  `binutils`, configure with  `--disable-sim`, the simulator will not build 
        for microblaze and youâ€™re unlikely to need it, so turn it off.
    for  `gcc`, enable LTO support but disable graphite: unfortunately 
        the library graphite needs to do its work will not build for microblaze 
        at this time.
    for  `newlib`, enable space savings

    Also for each of the tools (gcc, binutils, gdb, etc) configure the source location 
        to point to the absolute path to your extracted Xilinx source snapshots.

                                       --- disable c++
                                       --- enable ct_debug interative term, enable restart, 

      --- reverify the configuration below:
      --- change target/no-mmu
      --- change binitils/{source path, extra config}
      --- change gcc/{source path, no c++, use system zlib, enable LTO}
      --- change lib/{newlib, optimize for size}
      --- change debug/no-gdb
      --- change options/{debug ct, save, interactive, local tarball path, local source components}
      --- change lib/{again optimize for size later somehow this is lost}
      --- save config to logc-dot-config with new LTO settings compared to logb-dot-config



trying things out: 
  need to link to libxil.a from xilinx sdk. 
 
    microblaze-xilinx-elf-gcc -L/path/to/libs foo.c -o foo.elf
    microblaze-xilinx-elf-objcopy -S -I elf32-big foo.elf -O binary foo.bin
