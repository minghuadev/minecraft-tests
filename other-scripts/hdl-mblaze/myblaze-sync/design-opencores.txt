Introduction
--------------

The MB-Lite microprocessor is a ligth-weight implementation of the Microblaze Instruction Set Architecture. It is instruction and cycle compatible with the Microblaze EDK 10.1i. It is successfully tested on older and newer Xilinx platforms (EDK 9 and 11). The design has been successfully synthesized for an Altera board as well to show platform independence.


Features
----------

MB-Lite is a highly modular design and is therefore very simple to understand and modify. Features of the MicroBlaze architecture and MB-Lite implementation are:

    32-bit data- and instruction bus
    Harvard architecture
    Five pipeline stages
    Cycle as well as instruction compatible with the MicroBlaze Instruction Set Architecture
    Optional interrupt support
    Optional wishbone bus
    Optional multiplier
    Optional barrel shifter

The following instructions are currently not implemented. All of these instructions are not used by the compiler (mb-gcc) or can be replaced by software libraries.

    MULH, MULHU, MULHSU
    IDIV, IDIVU (Integer Division)
    TN* (Fast Simplex Link instructions)
    F* (Floating point instructions)
    PCM* (Pattern Compare)
    WIC, WDC (Cache instructions)
    MTS, MFS, MSR* (Special purpose register instructions)
    RTBD, RTED (Return from break / exception)


Included design examples
--------------------------

    Integer unit directly connected to instruction- and datamemory
    Integer unit with wishbone bus wrapper
    Integer unit with address decoder
    Integer unit with address decoder and wishbone bus adapter
    SOC for synthesis purposes


Methodology
-------------

The core is designed using the [two-process design methodology of Jiri Gaisler](http://www.gaisler.com/doc/vhdl2proc.pdf design-vhdl2proc.pdf). All modules use inferred components, the design is not targeted specificly to any platform. However, currently it is only tested on a Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA. All memory blocks and registers will synthesize to BRAM on xilinx devices.


Organization
--------------

The organization of the hardware corresponds closely to the implementation of the classic RISC pipeline of Hennesy & Patterson (Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Approach).

Performance
-------------

MB-Lite is tested on a Virtex 5 development board (XC5VLX110-3FF 1760). It is able to obtain 229 MHz (c.f. the original implementation obtains 227 MHz). Furthermore, MB-Lite has a lower Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) than MicroBlaze since MicroBlaze has a prefetch buffer which reduces the rate of instructions which can be fed into the processor. The execution time of MB-Lite is therefore approximately 10% lower than MicroBlaze.


TODO / Wishlist
-----------------

    Modify wishbone bus to support single cycle transfers
    Add Fast Simplex Link (FSL)
