Will dump the information in the header.
    mkimage -l uImage

Will get the content.
    tail -c+65 < uImage > out

will get it uncompressed if it was gzip-compressed.
    tail -c+65  < uImage | gunzip > out

If that was an initramfs, you can do  
    cpio -t < out 
or 
    pax < out 
to list the content.

If it's a ramdisk image, you can try and mount it with:
    mount -ro loop out /mnt




an example

$ ls -l package/images/kernel-h3v10.img 
-rwxr-xr-x 1  3317576 Jan 10  2012 package/images/kernel-h3v10.img
