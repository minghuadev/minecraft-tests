1. Build legato for localhost

make localhost


2. Source legato environment

bin/legs


3. run 'startlegato' script from bin directory

./bin/startlegato


4. go to apps/sample/hellowWorld and build helloWorld for localhost

cd apps/sample/helloWorld
make localhost   


5. When app is successfully built, go to _build_helloWorld/localhost/staging/bin and run binary. 

cd _build_helloWorld/localhost/staging/bin
./helloWorld

Also you can stop the localhost version of legato by running 'bin/stoplegato'.
