  Google's SMTP server requires authentication, so here's how to set it up:

    SMTP server (i.e., outgoing mail): smtp.gmail.com
    SMTP username: Your full Gmail or Google Apps email address 
                           (e.g. example@gmail.com or example@yourdomain.com)
    SMTP password: Your Gmail or Google Apps email password
    SMTP port: 465
    SMTP TLS/SSL required: yes

    In order to store a copy of outgoing emails in your Gmail or Google Apps Sent folder, 
          log into your Gmail or Google Apps email Settings and:
    Click on the Forwarding/IMAP tab and scroll down to the IMAP Access section: 
          IMAP must be enabled in order for emails to be properly copied to your sent folder.

NOTE: Google automatically rewrites the From line of any email you send via its SMTP 
 server to the default Send mail as email address in your Gmail or Google Apps email 
 account Settings. You need to be aware of this nuance because it affects 
 the presentation of your email, from the point of view of the recepient, and it may 
 also affect the Reply-To setting of some programs.

Workaround: In your Google email Settings, go to the Accounts tab/section and make 
 "default" an account other than your Gmail/Google Apps account. This will cause 
 Google's SMTP server to re-write the From field with whatever address you enabled 
 as the default Send mail as address.
