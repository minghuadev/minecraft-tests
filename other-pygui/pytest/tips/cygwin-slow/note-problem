The problem is that pytest searches for //pytest.ini, //tox.ini, //setup.cfg, and //setup.py. 
Each of them caused either genericpath.exists() or genericpath.isfile() to consume about 2.5 
seconds.

One fix is to add the lines below to genericpath.exists() and genericpath.isfile() to skip 
those four specific paths.

    if path.startswith(r'//'):
        return False

An alternative fix would be to modify _pytest/config.py so that it does not form those 
double-slash in the paths to search. 

Another way not to edit/hack the installation is to have cygwin invoke a windows native python 
instead of the cygwin python. That is, replace the command py.test with 
c:/python/path/Scripts/python.exe c:/ython/path/Scripts/py.test-script.py, 
if your windows python is installed at c:/python/path.
