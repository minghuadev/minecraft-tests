Create a file called conftest.py in your project root which contains this:

import pytest
import os
import subprocess
import tempfile

@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def start_xvfb_server (request):
    tempdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    xvfb_cmd = ['Xvfb',
                ':1022',
                '-screen', '0', '800x600x24',
                '-fbdir', tempdir,
                '-noreset'
    ]
    xvfb_proc = subprocess.Popen(xvfb_cmd,
            stdout=open(os.devnull),
            stderr=open(os.devnull),
            shell=False
    )
    request.addfinalizer(xvfb_proc.kill)

Now, all you have to do is to set up each tests to set the DISPLAY to 1022 which is trivial to do.

you might also return the port number so that other fixtures can easily access 
it by stating "start_xvfb_server" as an argument. Also you might want to 
not use "autouse=True" but instead put @pytest.mark.usefixtures("start_xvfb_server") 
on a class or so. This way you don't setup the process for tests not needing it.
