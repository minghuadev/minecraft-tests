[py-dev] py.test tkinter frontend

    Next message: [py-dev] py.test tkinter frontend

Hello,

i finished my rewrite of a tkinter-frontend for py.test. what's the best
way to share it?

i can post a screenshot and a tar.gz file (35kb).

some informations about the package:

it lives under py/test/gui and works only in the py-collect branch.
it provides a tree view for all tests. every test can be executed just
by double clicking it.
the frontend watches all files and directories specified at the command
line.
if a test fails, a text widget shows a report similar to the current
report by py.test (it uses TerminalDriver). all filenames in a report
are links and open a text editor (see tkgui.py/TkMain.launch_editor) to
show the point of failure.
if a test fails the frontend calls tkinter.bell(), so you can hear if
your changes break some code (should be an option).
--collectonly, --nocapture, --showlocals , --fulltrace, --nomagic,
should work as expected.

todo:

* documentation, documentation

* more tests ;-)

* replace hack for config.py and conftest.py !!

* patch drive.py/Driver.runone -> call finish after the captured output
is set (see py.test.gui.guidriver.py/GuiDriver.runone)

* improve performance of tree widget when updating test results!!

i would appreciate your feedback and comments!
thank you!

jan

That is actually important and i know that writing 
tests for interactive applications ca be hard especially
if done after the fact ...

i'd like to see what you have done and how it compares 
to the hacks we have done for PyPy :-)

i am still somewhat ill and have personal issues to 
care for at the moment ... so if others can give your
code a try (once it is checked in) that would be great ... 

cheers & many thanks,
