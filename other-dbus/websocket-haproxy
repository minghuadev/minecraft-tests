Configuring HAProxy for WebSocket
October 6, 2011 Jeanfrancois Arcand

A lot of peoples (including myself at Wordnik) needed to configure HAProxy 
in order to make WebSocket working. For my Atmosphere Framework project, 
I’m using:


$ cat /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
global
    maxconn     4096 # Total Max Connections. This is dependent on ulimit
    nbproc      1

defaults
    mode        http

frontend all 0.0.0.0:80
    timeout client 86400000
    default_backend www_backend
    acl is_websocket hdr(Upgrade) -i WebSocket
    acl is_websocket hdr_beg(Host) -i ws

    use_backend socket_backend if is_websocket

backend www_backend
    balance roundrobin
    option forwardfor # This sets X-Forwarded-For
    timeout server 30000
    timeout connect 4000
    server apiserver 127.0.0.1:8080 weight 1 maxconn 1024 check

backend socket_backend
    balance roundrobin
    option forwardfor # This sets X-Forwarded-For
    timeout queue 5000
    timeout server 86400000
    timeout connect 86400000
    server apiserver targetserver:7777 weight 1 maxconn 1024 check

Just as a reference for anyone else who finds this as a way to get 
Atmosphere/Nettosphere working behind a HAproxy load balancer, this 
HAproxy config only works with HAproxy versions before 1.5. I tried 
to get this working with HAproxy 1.5 (dev17) to no avail. Nettosphere 
by itself works great, but as soon as you turn on HAproxy (pointing 
at the Nettosphere instance as a “backend”, Nettosphere starts spewing 
a continuous stream of exceptions like this:
....

But as soon as downgrade HAproxy to latest version of 1.3 
(haven’t tried 1.4 yet), all is fine. No more exceptions. Nettosphere 
works as expected behind HAproxy. So something that was changed 
in HAproxy 1.5 is causing this.

Anyways, I hope this helps somebody else who also finds this as 
an example of getting Nettosphere working behind HAproxy. Stick to 
HAproxy 1.3 and you’ll be fine.
