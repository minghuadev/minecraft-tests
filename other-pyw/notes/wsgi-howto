How do I use Python with apache2?

mod_python is basically non-maintained - you should look into mod_wsgi. 
Install the package libapache2-mod-wsgi, then issue sudo a2enmod wsgi 
to enable it.

Just as a quick example to get it running, stuff something like this 
in your /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default:

    WSGIScriptAlias /test /path/to/python/file.py

And in the file /path/to/python/file.py:

    def application(environ, start_response):
        start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
        return "Hello World"

After re-starting Apache2, any request to /test will turn into a call 
of application() in your python file.

Python (unsurprisingly) has a small WSGI server in the standard library 
for testing. If you add this in the bottom of your file, you can run it 
as any old executable for testing purposes, and then let Apache take over 
for production:

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
    
        httpd = make_server('', 8080, application)
        print "Serving on http://localhost:8080"
    
        httpd.serve_forever()
