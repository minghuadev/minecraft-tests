PyPy.js Update: A Proof-of-Concept JIT
==========================================

Two weeks ago I hatched a plan to [port Python to the Web Platform]() by using 
[Emscripten]() to translate [PyPy]() into JavaScript. My hope is to produce something 
than can run in the browser with performance comparable to a standard Python 
interpreter, a hope which hinges on two key ingredients:

  * PyPy's powerful [just-in-time compiler](), which can optimize the hot loops 
    of your program into efficient native code.
  * The recent work on [asm.js](asmjs.org), a low-level subset of JavaScript 
    that can act like an efficient virtual machine in the browser.

By translating the PyPy interpreter into asm.js code, and by having its JIT backend 
emit specialized asm.js code at runtime, it should theoretically be possible 
to have an in-browser Python implementation whose hot loops perform within a factor 
of two of native code.

I'm excited to report a small but important milestone on the road to making this 
a reality.
