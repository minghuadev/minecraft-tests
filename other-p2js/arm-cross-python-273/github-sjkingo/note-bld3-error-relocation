bld2armv5.sh
if set mystatic=0 , even without enabling install at stage 4 (commented out now), it has the error:

R_ARM_TLS_LE32 relocation not permitted in shared object


  solution: build for target python only

  reason: it was building for python, oldsharedmods, sharedmods, gdbhooks
          building any shared mods would cause the problem
