bld2armv5.sh
if set mystatic=0 , and enable install at stage 4 (commented out now), it has an error:

R_ARM_TLS_LE32 relocation not permitted in shared object

  solution: not turn on stage 4 install. use bld3collect.sh.

When I tried to include library statically, it pulled in the static C library into my shared library.  The static C library contains relocations that cannot be used in a shared library.

Some online article suggested recompiling the gcc with the "--disable-libmudflap" will fix the problem.

For me, I just need to link the libc dynamic instead of shared.  So in my LDFLAGS, I added -Wl -Bstatic in front of my two static libs and -Wl -Bdynamic afterward.  Problem solved.

Hello. I ran into this same error, and after trying your suggestion (and some other approaches). None of the approaches worked for me. I found I only had to remove the '-static' flag from the compiler flags and no other flags were required. I initially thought I need '-static' for compilation, but it turns out I did not.

Not sure if this applies to your project, but it was much easier than the alternative approaches.

Same here bduhbya, removing the -static flag from my LDFLAGS fixed the relocation issue. Need some more thought onto why...
