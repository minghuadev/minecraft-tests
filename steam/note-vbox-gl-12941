3D not working on Ubuntu 14.04 -> fixed as of 27 May 2014 in VirtualBox 4.3.x and later releases after 27 May 2014

Cause and Fix
=================

It was caused by a small change in Mesa authentication against the X server<1> 
triggering a hidden problem in our driver. The commit which fixes it is 
not yet publicly visible in our time line<2>; when it appears (probably on Monday), 
the commit message will be: "Additions/x11/vboxvideo: properly report the file 
descriptor for the kernel driver to allow authentication to work."

Thanks for the helpful work identifying the problem.

General note to everyone commenting on this ticket. If 3D is working 
in your guest then the output of "glxinfo" should include:

OpenGL vendor string: Humper
OpenGL renderer string: Chromium

The following warnings will always appear, even when 3D is working, due to 
a problem in the way our driver is implemented which is not simple to fix:

<1> http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/commit/?id=5198981
<2> https://www.virtualbox.org/timeline

By the way, for self-builders the change set for the fix is r51374. 
VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.13-93885.iso fixed the 3D support.



messages to determine 3D ok
===========================
OpenGL vendor string:   Humper
OpenGL renderer string: Chromium
OpenGL version string:  2.1 Chromium 1.9
