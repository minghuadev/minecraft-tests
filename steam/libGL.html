<h2 id="libgl">libGL</h2>

<h3 id="whatislibgl">What is libGL?</h3>

<p>OpenGL-based programs must link with the <em>libGL</em> library. <em>libGL</em> implements the GLX interface as well as the main OpenGL API entrypoints. When using indirect rendering, <em>libGL</em> creates GLX protocol messages and sends them to the X server via a socket. When using direct rendering, <em>libGL</em> loads the appropriate 3D DRI driver then dispatches OpenGL library calls directly to that driver. </p>

<p>libGL also has the ability to support heterogeneous, multi-head 
configurations. That means one could have two or more graphics cards (of
 different types) in one system and libGL would allow an application 
program to use all of them simultaneously. </p>

<h3 id="wheredoeslibglreside">Where does libGL reside?</h3>

<p>The GLcore extension source code resides at <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/GL/">xc/lib/GL/GL/</a> . </p>

<h3 id="libgl3ddriver">libGL (3D) Driver</h3>

<p>A DRI aware 3D driver currently based on Mesa. </p>

<h4 id="wheredoesthe3ddriverreside">Where does the 3D Driver reside?</h4>

<p>Normally libGL loads 3D DRI drivers from the <code>/usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri</code> directory but the search patch can be overridden by setting the <code>LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH</code> environment variable. </p>

<p>The DRI aware 3D driver resides in <code>xc/lib/GL/mesa/src/drv</code> </p>

<h2 id="thedridriverinitializationprocess">The DRI driver initialization process</h2>

<ul>
<li>The whole process begins when an application calls glXCreateContext (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/glx/glxcmds.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/glx/glxcmds.c</a>). glXCreateContext is just a stub that call <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=CreateContext&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>CreateContext</span>. The real work begins when <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=CreateContext&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>CreateContext</span> calls <code>__glXInitialize</code> (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/glx/glxext.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/glx/glxext.c</a>). </li>
<li>The driver specific initialization process starts with <code>__driCreateScreen</code>.
 Once the driver is loaded (via dlopen), dlsym is used to get a pointer 
to this function. The function pointer for each driver is stored in the <em>createScreen</em> array in the <code>__DRIdisplay</code> structure. This initialization is done in driCreateDisplay (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/dri/dri_glx.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/dri/dri_glx.c</a>), which is called by <code>__glXInitialize</code>. Note that <code>__driCreateScreen</code>
 really is the bootstrap of a DRI driver. It's the only  function in a 
DRI driver that libGL directly knows about. All the other DRI functions 
are accessed via the <code>__DRIdisplayRec</code>, <code>__DRIscreenRec</code>, <code>__DRIcontextRec</code> and <code>__DRIdrawableRec</code> structs defined in <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/glx/glxclient.h?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/glx/glxclient.h</a>). Those structures are pretty well documented in the file. </li>
<li>After performing the <code>__glXInitialize</code> step, <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=CreateContext&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>CreateContext</span>
 calls the createContext function for the requested screen. Here the 
driver creates two data structures. The first, GLcontext, contains all 
of the device independent state, device dependent constants (i.e., 
texture size limits, light limits, etc.), and device dependent function 
tables. The driver also allocates a structure that contains all of the 
device dependent state. The GLcontext structure links to the device 
dependent structure via the <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=DriverCtx&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>DriverCtx</span>
 pointer. The device dependent structure also has a pointer back to the 
GLcontext structure. The device dependent structure is where the driver 
will store context specific hardware state (register settings, etc.) for
 when context (in terms of OpenGL / X context) switches occur. This 
structure is analogous to the buffers where the OS stores CPU state 
where a program context switch occurs. The texture images really are 
stored within Mesa's data structures. Mesa supports about a dozen 
texture formats which happen to satisfy what all the DRI drivers need. 
So, the texture format/ packing is dependent on the hardware, but Mesa 
understands all the common formats. See Mesa/src/texformat.h. Gareth and
 Brian spent a lot of time on that. </li>
<li>createScreen (i.e., the driver specific initialization function) is called for each screen from <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=AllocAndFetchScreenConfigs&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>AllocAndFetchScreenConfigs</span> (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/glx/glxext.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/glx/glxext.c</a>). This is also called from <code>__glXInitialize</code>. </li>
<li>For all of the existing drivers, the <code>__driCreateScreen</code> function is just a wrapper that calls <code>__driUtilCreateScreen</code> (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/dri/dri_util.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/dri/dri_util.c</a>) with a pointer to the driver's API function table (of type <code>__DriverAPIRec</code>). This creates a <code>__DRIscreenPrivate</code>
 structure for the display and fills it in (mostly) with the supplied 
parameters (i.e., screen number, display information, etc.). It also 
opens and initializes the connection to DRM. This includes opening the 
DRM device, mapping the frame buffer (note: the DRM documentation says 
that the function used for this is called drmAddMap, but it is actually 
called drmMap), and mapping the SAREA. The final step is to call the 
driver initialization function for the driver (from the <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=InitDriver&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>InitDriver</span> field in the <code>__DriverAPIRec</code> (DriverAPI field of the <code>__DRIscreenPrivate</code>). </li>
<li>The <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=InitDriver&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>InitDriver</span>
 function does (at least in the Radeon and i810 drivers) two broad 
things. It first verifies the version of the services (XFree86, DDX, and
 DRM) that it will use. The driver then creates an internal 
representation of the screen and stores it (the pointer to the 
structure) in the private field of the <code>__DRIscreenPrivate</code> 
structure. The driver-private data may include things such as mappings 
of MMIO registers, mappings of display and texture memory, information 
about the layout of video memory, chipset version specific data (feature
 availability for the specific chip revision, etc.), and other similar 
data. This is the handle that identifies the specific graphics card to 
the driver (in case there is more than one card in the system that will 
use the same driver). </li>
<li>After performing the <code>__glXInitialize</code> step, <span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=CreateContext&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>CreateContext</span>
 calls the createContext function for the requested screen. This is 
where it gets pretty complicated. I have only looked at the Radeon 
driver. radeonCreateContext (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/dri/xc/xc/lib/GL/mesa/src/drv/radeon/radeon_context.c?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">xc/lib/GL/mesa/src/drv/radeon/radeon_context.c</a>) allocates a GLcontext structure (actually <code>struct __GLcontextRec</code> from extras/Mesa/src/mtypes.h). Here it fills in function tables for virtually every OpenGL call. Additionally, the <code>__GLcontextRec</code>
 has pointers to buffers where the driver will store context specific 
hardware state (textures, register settings, etc.) for when context (in 
terms of OpenGL / X context) switches occur. The <code>__GLcontextRec</code>
 (i.e. GLcontext in Mesa) doesn't have any buffers of hardware-specific 
data (except texture image data if you want to be picky). All 
Radeon-specific, per-context data should be hanging off of the struct 
radeon_context. All the DRI drivers define a hardware-specific context 
structure (such as structure radeon_context, typedef'd to be 
radeonContextRec, or structure mga_context_t typedef'd to be 
mgaContext). radeonContextRec has a pointer back to the Mesa <code>__GLcontextRec</code> and Mesa's <code>__GLcontextRec-&gt;DriverCtx</code> pointer points back to the radeonContextRec. If we were writing all this in C++ (don't laugh) we'd treat Mesa's <code>__GLcontextRec</code>
 as a base class and create driver-specific derived classes from it. 
Inheritance like this is actually pretty common in the DRI code, even 
though it's sometimes hard to spot. These buffers are analogous to the 
buffers where the OS stores CPU state where a program context switch 
occurs. Note that we don't do any fancy hardware context switching in 
our drivers. When we make-current a new context, we basically update all
 the hardware state with that new context's values. </li>
<li>When each of the function tables is initialized (see 
radeonInitSpanFuncs for an example), an internal Mesa function is 
called. This function (e.g., <em>swrast</em><span class="createlink"><a href="https://secure.freedesktop.org/write/dri/ikiwiki.cgi?page=GetDeviceDriverReference&amp;from=libGLDriver&amp;do=create" rel="nofollow">?</a>GetDeviceDriverReference</span>)
 both allocates the buffer and fills in the function pointers with the 
software fallbacks. If a driver were to just call these allocation 
functions and not replace any of the function pointers, it would be the 
same as the software renderer. </li>
<li>The next part seems to start when the createDrawable function in the <code>__DRIscreenRec</code>
 is called, but I don't see where this happens. createDrawable should be
 called via glXMakeCurrent since that's the first time we're given an X 
drawable handle. Somewhere during glXMakeCurrent we use a DRI hash 
lookup to translate the X Drawable handle into an pointer to a <code>__DRIdrawable</code>. If we get a <code>NULL</code> pointer that means we've never seen that handle before and now have to allocate the <code>__DRIdrawable</code> and initialize it (and put it in the hash table). -- <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/IanRomanick/">IanRomanick</a> and <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/BrianPaul/">BrianPaul</a> </li>

<h3 id="ofwhatuseisthemesacodeinthexctree">Of what use is the Mesa code in the xc tree?</h3>

<p>Mesa is used to build some server side modules/libraries specifically
 for the benefit of the DRI. The libGL is the client side aspect of Mesa
 which works closely with the server side components of Mesa. </p>

<p>The GLU and GLUT libraries are entirely client side things, and so they are distributed separately. </p>

<h3 id="isthereanydocumentationaboutthexmesacalls">Is there any documentation about the XMesa* calls?</h3>

<p>There is no documentation for those functions. However, one can point out a few things. </p>

<p>First, despite the prolific use of the word "Mesa" in the client (and
 server) side DRI code, the DRI is not dependent on Mesa. It's a common 
misconception that the DRI was designed just for Mesa. It's just that 
the drivers that we at Precision Insight have done so far have Mesa at 
their core. Other groups are working on non-Mesa-based DRI drivers. </p>

<p>In the client-side code, you could mentally replace the string 
"XMesa" with "Driver" or some other generic term. All the code below <code>xc/lib/GL/mesa/</code>
 could be replaced by alternate code. libGL would still work. libGL has 
no knowledge whatsoever of Mesa. It's the drivers which it loads that 
have the Mesa code. </p>

<p>On the server side there's more of the same. The XMesa code used for 
indirect/software rendering was originally borrowed from stand-alone 
Mesa and its pseudo GLX implementation. There are some crufty 
side-effects from that. </p>

<p> that's not really true- there's also the <code>__driRegisterExtensions</code> function that libGL uses to implement glXGetProcAddress. That's another long story. </p>

<h3 id="howdoxmodulesandxapplicationscommunicate">How do X modules and X applications communicate?</h3>

<p>X modules are loaded like kernel modules, with symbol resolution at 
load time, and can thus call each other functions. For kernel modules, 
the communication between applications and modules is done via the <em>/dev/*</em> files. </p>

<p>X applications call X libraries function which creates a packet and 
sends it to the server via sockets which processes it. That's all well 
documented in the standard X documentation. </p>

<p>There are 3 ways 3D clients can communicate with the server or each other: </p>

<ol>
<li>Via the X protocol requests. There are DRI extensions. </li>
<li>Via the SAREA (the shared memory segment) </li>
<li>Via the kernel driver. </li>
</ol>
